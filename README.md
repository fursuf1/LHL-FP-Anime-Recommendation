## Overview 🌟
This repository consists of two main notebooks:

- **[Notebook 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Dataset Overview](link_to_notebook1)** 📊:
  This notebook focuses on comprehensive data exploration and analysis of the anime datasets. Through visualizations and insights, it delves into the distribution of anime titles, genres, user ratings, and other pertinent features.

- **[Notebook 2: Model Training](link_to_notebook2)** 🤖:
  Notebook 2 deals with training the anime recommendation model. It involves implementing various machine learning algorithms using TensorFlow, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.

## Techniques Used 🔧
The anime recommendation system leverages the following techniques:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) 📊: Understanding the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the anime datasets using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualization.
- **Machine Learning algorithms** 🤖: Utilizing TensorFlow framework for recommendation system development, employing techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
- **WordCloud** ☁️: Employed for visualizing text data within anime titles, synopsis, and other textual information, providing a graphical representation of word frequency.
- **Language Detection (langdetect)** 🌐: Utilizing langdetect library to detect the primary language in 'Other name' fields, aiding in language-specific analysis or processing.

## TensorFlow 🤖
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's widely used for building and training machine learning models, particularly in the domain of neural networks. For our anime recommendation system, TensorFlow facilitates the creation and training of recommendation models, allowing for the development of advanced algorithms like collaborative filtering or deep learning-based models.

## WordCloud ☁️
[WordCloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) is a data visualization technique used to represent text data, emphasizing the frequency of words through their size in a visual cloud. In our project, WordCloud was employed to visually showcase word frequency within anime titles, synopsis, or other textual information from the dataset, aiding in the identification of prominent terms or phrases.

## langdetect 🌐
[Langdetect](https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/) is a language detection library in Python that identifies the primary language of a given text. In our project, langdetect was utilized to detect and classify the primary language from the 'Other name' fields in the anime dataset. This information aids in language-specific analysis, potentially enabling language-based recommendations or insights for multilingual users.

## Instructions 📝

## Model Training with Deep Learning 🧠

### 3D Visualization of Ratings Graphs 📊
The 3D Visualization of Ratings Graphs was employed to understand the interaction between user ratings and anime features in a multidimensional space. It helps in visualizing the relationship and patterns within the data for better model comprehension.

### Model Training (Collaborative Filtering) 🤝
Collaborative Filtering: The collaborative filtering technique was implemented for model training. It involves predicting user preferences for anime titles based on similar users' preferences. This method explores user-item interactions and recommends anime based on user behavior.

### Bokeh Plotting for Model Metrics 📊
Bokeh Plotting: Bokeh Plotting was utilized for visualizing model loss, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) against epochs in inverted bar graphs. This plotting technique offers interactive visualizations, enabling a detailed view of model performance throughout the training process.

### Item-Based Recommendation Section 📚
Item-Based Recommendation: The item-based recommendation approach was used to suggest anime titles based on similarities between items. It identifies similar anime titles and recommends them to users who have interacted with comparable items in the past.

### User-Based Recommendation 🤖
User-Based Recommendation: The user-based recommendation technique analyzes user behavior and preferences to recommend anime titles to similar users. It identifies users with similar tastes and suggests anime based on their interactions and preferences.

### Model Training: Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Recommendations 🔍
Content-Based Filtering: Content-Based Filtering (CBF) was employed for model training, focusing on anime features such as genre, type, duration, and more. This technique generates recommendations based on the content similarities between anime titles and user preferences.

## Challenges 🤔
- Managing a very large dataset, which posed challenges in handling and processing due to its size and complexity.
- Training and testing the models required extensive time due to the dataset's scale, often necessitating multiple attempts to optimize hyperparameters and achieve the right epochs.
- Addressing computational limitations and resource constraints when dealing with extensive training tasks and testing iterations.

## Learning Outcome 🎓
- Acquired proficiency in data preprocessing techniques for diverse datasets.
- Enhanced understanding of machine learning algorithms, especially in the context of recommendation systems.
- Improved skills in data visualization and interpretation, particularly within the anime domain.
